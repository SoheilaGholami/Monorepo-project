# general conventions

- Define separate files for types.
- The type file name should follow this format: `fileName.types.ts`.
- The `components` folder should not have a deep hierarchy. A two-level hierarchy is acceptable.
- The `hooks`, `utils`, and `types` folders should remain flat with no hierarchy. If there are multiple files for hooks, utils, etc., they should be placed inside a folder. Otherwise, they should be individual files.
